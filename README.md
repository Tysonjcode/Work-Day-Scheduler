# Work-Day-Scheduler
UWA Bootcamp week 5 work day scheduler challange 

This is my work day schedular challage for UWA coding bootcamp where it displayes the current day at the top and then has a schedular under it for 9am to 5pm. In the schedular you can input tasks or appointments with text and then using save to local storage you can click the save button to save this content and it will stay even if you refresh the window.

The schedular wil also change colour at at 12:00am every night to display all green section where you in put text and when the current time with in the scheduler is met, I.e 9am, that row will change red while the rest are green. Fter that time is passsed to 10am it will change to grey and 10 am row will turn green. This shows you whith the clour red that it is on that current time.
